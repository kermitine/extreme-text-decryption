extreme text decryption with proprietary algorithm

reuses lots of code from extreme-text-encryption

uses PyEnchant for word comprehension. Prone to errors due to the method, but relatively reliable

maintains punctuation's original positioning before and after

currently cant re-capitalize a sentence---band aid solution is that it converts everything to lower case.
